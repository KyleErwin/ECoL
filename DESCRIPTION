Description: The Extended data Complexity Library (ECoL) is the implementation in R of a set of 
  measures to characterize the complexity of classification problems based on ambiguity and 
  separation between the classes and the data sparsity and dimensionality of the datasets. The 
  measures were originally proposed by Ho and Basu (2002) and extend by many other works including 
  the DCoL. The main difference between the libraries is that ECoL provides bug fixes, 
  generalizations and implementations of many other state-of-the-art measures.
