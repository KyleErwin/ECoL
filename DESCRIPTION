Description: The Extended Complexity Library (ECoL) is the implementation in R 
  of a set of measures to characterize the complexity of classification problems
  based on ambiguity and separation between the classes and the data sparsity 
  and dimensionality of the datasets. The measures were originally proposed by 
  Ho and Basu (2002) and extend by many other works including the DCoL libray. 
  The main difference between the libraries is that ECoL provides bug fixes, 
  generalizations and implementations of many other state-of-the-art measures.
