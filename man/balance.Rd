\usage{
balance(...)

\method{balance}{default}(x, y, measures = "all", ...)

\method{balance}{formula}(formula, data, measures = "all", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Not used.
The details section describes the valid values for this group.}

\item{x}{A data.frame contained only the input attributes.}

\item{y}{A factor response vector with one label for each row/component of x.}

\item{measures}{A list of measures names or \code{"all"} to include all them.}

\item{formula}{A formula to define the class column.}

\item{data}{A data.frame dataset contained the input attributes and class.}
}
\value{
A list named by the requested class balance measure.
}
\description{
These measures capture the differences in the number of examples per class in
the training dataset. When these differences are severe, problems related to 
generalization of the ML classification techniques could happen because of
the imbalance ratio.
}
\details{
The following measures are allowed for this method:
 \describe{
   \item{"C1"}{The entropy of class proportions measure to capture the 
     imbalance in a dataset. It can be expressed as: 
     \deqn{C1 = -\frac{1}{\log(n_c)}\sum_{i=1}^{n_c} p_i \log(p_i)}
     where \eqn{p_i = n_i/n$} is the proportion of examples in each of the 
     classes.}
   \item{"C2"}{The imbalance ratio measure is a index computed for measuring 
     class balance. This is a version of the measure that is also suited for 
     multiclass classification problems:
     \deqn{C2 = \frac{n_c-1}{n_c}\sum_{i=1}^{n_c}{\frac{n_i}{n-n_i}}}
     where n_i is the number of instances from the i-th class.}
